# You must implement a Bernoulli Naive Bayes model from scratch (i.e., without using any external libraries such as SciKit learn). You are free to use any text preprocessing that you like with this model. Hint 1: you many want to use Laplace smoothing with your Bernoulli Naive Bayes model. Hint 2: you are allowed to choose the vocabulary for your model (i.e, which words you include vs. ignore), but you should provide justification for the vocabulary you use.
